Iam Saisrinu and I am writing to express my interest in Software Engineering opportunities at {{company_name}}. I recently graduated with a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, but my passion for technology led me to pursue additional skills in Python, Django, and JavaScript.

While my academic background is in a different field, I am confident that my technical skills and eagerness to learn make me a suitable candidate for a Software Engineering role. I am a quick learner and have a strong foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking.

I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and knowledge to your team and am eager to learn more about the opportunities available. I have attached my resume for your review, and I would welcome the chance to discuss my qualifications further.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Saisrinu Gampa
